The USGS Texas Water Science Center method of creating a watershed basin delination is compared against the ESRI ready-to-use watershed tool.  A handful of watersheds were delineated twice - using the USGS and ESRI methods - and compared to determine their pros and cons.  It was determined that the ESRI method is beneficial in creating a delineation to better understand the general basin shape and size, but is not high enough quality to include in a publication.  The USGS method is slower, yet more accurate and needs less editing in the end to produce a delineation.
